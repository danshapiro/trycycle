## Installing Trycycle

### If you are human

Tell your favorite coding agent (Claude Code, Codex CLI, etc.):

```
Read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danshapiro/trycycle/main/README.md. Follow the installation instructions there.
```

### If you've been sent here by your human

Use this instead of a standard installation, or it won't work. Clone into your skills directory:

- **Claude Code:** `git clone https://github.com/danshapiro/trycycle.git ~/.claude/skills/trycycle`
- **Codex CLI:** `git clone https://github.com/danshapiro/trycycle.git ~/.codex/skills/trycycle`

Trycycle requires `python3` at runtime. Make sure it is installed and on your `PATH`.

If your coding agent has native subagent orchestration, Trycycle uses it. Otherwise, it falls back to a bundled stdlib-only Python runner.

Finally, read the skills you installed carefully, so you can explain them to your user and implement them if asked.

## Using Trycycle

Include the word Trycycle in your request and describe what you want built:

```
Use trycycle to add a dark mode toggle to the settings page.
```

Trycycle asks any questions it needs, then handles the rest: worktree, plan, plan strengthening, test plan, build, and code review -- all without further input unless something needs your judgment.

Works for anything from small features to large refactors, best when you have a clear goal and a codebase Trycycle can read and test.

## How it works

Trycycle is a hill climber. It writes a plan, then sends it to a fresh plan editor with the same task input and repo context. That editor either approves the plan unchanged or rewrites it, repeating up to five rounds. Once the plan is locked, Trycycle builds a test plan, builds the code, sends it to a fresh reviewer, fixes what the reviewer finds, and repeats that loop too (up to eight rounds). Each review uses a new reviewer with no memory of previous rounds, and each planning round spawns a fresh agent, so stale context never accumulates.

## Credits

Trycycle's planning, execution, and worktree management skills are adapted from [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) by [Jesse Vincent](https://github.com/obra). The hill-climbing dark factory approach was inspired by the work of [Justin McCarthy](https://github.com/jmccarthy), [Jay Taylor](https://github.com/jaytaylor), and [Navan Chauhan](https://github.com/navanchauhan) at [StrongDM](https://github.com/strongdm).
